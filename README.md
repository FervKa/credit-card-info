My Name is Stiven, I am a Web Developer and I made this.

**Note:  any question that you have, I'm open to feedback**

Sorry, I used a library to make the toast for user feedback, since I ran into an inconvenience and didn't have the time to do everything as well.

**Note: about ccv encryption and dataset**
As you know, at the 8 numeral, you ask for the ccv to be encrypted and stored in a dataset. I performed the encryption with a Js own function, but, deprecated called `btoa`. I understand what the dataset is, however, I do not know and did not find a way to do it in ReactJs, which was the library that I used for this project.
